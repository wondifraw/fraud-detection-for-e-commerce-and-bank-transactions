## Overview

This project provides a robust, modular pipeline for detecting fraudulent transactions in e-commerce and banking datasets. The workflow covers all key stages of a modern data science project, including data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, geolocation enrichment, class imbalance handling, normalization, and lays the groundwork for advanced modeling and explainability.

**Key Features:**
- Modular Python codebase for easy extension and maintenance
- Comprehensive EDA with both univariate and bivariate analysis
- Automated handling of missing data, outliers, and class imbalance
- Geolocation enrichment using IP-to-country mapping
- Feature engineering for time, frequency, and user behavior
- Ready for integration with machine learning models
- Jupyter notebook for interactive exploration and reproducibility
- Unit tests for core pipeline components
- Continuous Integration (CI) with GitHub Actions

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for all Python dependencies:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - imbalanced-learn
  - ipython
  - jupyter
  - pytest

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd fraud-detection-for-e-commerce-and-bank-transactions
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Run the Main Pipeline

```bash
python scripts/main.py
```

### Explore the Data Interactively

Open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/exploration.ipynb
```

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
pytest tests/test_pipeline.py
```

## Example

```python
from src.eda import EDA
eda = EDA()
eda.univariate_analysis(df)  # Plots up to 2 univariate distributions
eda.bivariate_analysis(df, target_col='class')  # Plots up to 2 bivariate plots
```

## Results and Reporting

- See `Report.md` for methodology, results, and recommendations.
- Generated plots and figures are saved in the `figures/` directory.

## Data

- Place your raw data files in the `data/` directory.
- Data sources: [Specify your data sources here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI, etc.]

## Continuous Integration (CI)

- This project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI.
- The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and runs tests on every push or pull request to `main`.
- The CI badge at the top of this README will show the current build status.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues with dependencies, ensure your Python version matches the requirements and that your virtual environment is activated.
- For Jupyter notebook issues, ensure all dependencies are installed and the kernel is set to your virtual environment.
- For CI failures, check the Actions tab on GitHub for logs and error messages.
